Object:
    - Clear all the tiles on the board by flipping them over one by one without your Population dropping to 0

Set Up:
    - 9 tiles are placed face-down on the board. Player starts with 10 Population and 50 food.
    - Population is separated into two groups: Hunters and Gatherers; default is 5/5. 
    
Play:
    - Player selects one tile to turn over. It can be one of four tiles:
        - Land: Player loses 1 Food/Population.
        - Berry: Player gains +1 Food/Gatherer, plus .25 Food/Gatherer/Round
        - Goat: Player gains +3 Food/Hunter, plus .6 Food/Hunter/Round
        - Predator: Player loses 1 Population, prioritizing Hunters.
    - Player continues to flip over tiles until the board is cleared.
    - At the end of the round, the new population is used to determine the number of tiles placed for the next round.
    - If the player reaches a Population less than 1, the game is over.
    
Rules:
    - At the start of the game, the number of each type of tile is determined:
        - 40% of tiles are Land
        - 25% of tiles are Berries
        - 20% of tiles are Predator
        - 15% of tiles are Goats
    - Every other round, the percentage of Predator tiles increases by +4%, the percentage of Land tiles decreases by -2%, and Goat and Berry cards decrease by -1%.
    - The exact number of tiles generated is rounded based on these percentages; if the number of tiles generated this way is less than the number of tiles that are supposed to exist, an additional Predator tile is added.
    - Tiles are placed in a square grid of n by n, or in a rectangular grid of n by n + 1, where n cannot be less than 3 or more than 8.
    - Therefore, the possible tile arrangements are:
        - 3 X 3
        - 3 X 4
        - 4 X 4
        - 4 X 5
        - 5 X 5
        - 5 X 6
        - 6 X 6
        - 6 X 7
        - 7 X 7
        - 7 X 8
        - 8 X 8
    - If the population exceeds the number of tiles doubled, the next tile arrangement is used.
    - If a map has two different dimensions, it will be wider than long.
    - Players can store a Max of 100 Food. Every round, this increases by 15.
    - For every 0.5 Food/Population, there is a 5% chance per turn to increase Population by +1.
        - Each birth has a 5% chance to be Twins, granting +2 population.
    
Gold Cards
    - There is a 2% chance for a selected tile to become a Gold Tile, a more powerful version of the standard Tile.
    - After finding a Gold tile, the percentage drops to 0% for 5 turns.
    - Only standard Tiles may have Gold variants.
    
    Gold Land: Player loses 0.5 Food/Population, and Starvation doesn't take affect this turn.
    Gold Berry: Player Gains +2 Food/Gatherer, plus 0.25 Food/Gatherer/Round
    Gold Goat: Player gains +6 Food/Hunter, plus 0.6 Food/Hunter/Round
    Gold Predator: Player loses 2 Population, prioritizing Hunters.

Special Event Tiles

    - There is a cumulative +0.5% chance that the selected tile will instead be a Special Event Tile.
    - Once a Special Event Tile is spawned, the chance is set back to 0% for 5 turns before it starts building again.
